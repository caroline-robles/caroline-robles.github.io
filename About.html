            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <h2>Life Enthusiast and Music Lover</h2>
            <h3> <strong>The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams." <em>-Oprah Winfrey</em></strong></h3>
    
                <p>I am a junior at the beautiful <a href="http://www.UFL.edu">University of Florida</a> and working towards a degree in Telecommunications in Media and Society with a minor in Business Management.</p>
                <p>Ever since I was little, I have always been drawn to music. Music is the strongest element of art form; as it appeals to more than just our auditory sense. I am excited and hopeful that these passions for music will transition into a future career path, and I end up working somewhere within the industry. </p>
                <p>Passions of mine include: spending time with my loved ones and friends, playing with animals, going to concerts, discovering new artists, and who doesn't love getting lost in a television series? </p>
                <p>I've always heard the phrase, "if you do what you love, you never work a day in your life", and I'm finally beginning to understand that true meaning. Following my passions and working towards making my dreams a reality has been one of the greatest adventures of my life thus far.</p>
            
            <h2>Being a Part of the Gator Nation</h2>
                <p>Having started my college career at Florida State University, I never felt that I was reaching my true potential as a student. In spring of 2013, I decided to reach that full potential, and transferred to the University of Florida.</p>
                <p>Since becoming a Gator, I have become involved with the Gainesville based website, <a href="http://www.collegefuse.com"> CollegeFuse</a> and a service club called Heal the World.</p>
                <p>By being a part of an elite university, not only am I challenged daily by my professors, but my peers as well. I am confident that the lessons learned inside and outside of the classroom will lead me down a road of success.</p>
                <p>Although being born and raised a <strong>LOYAL</strong> seminole fan, I couldn't have more pride in being a University of Florida Gator.</p>
