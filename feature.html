            <h1>Mental Health Awareness</h1>
            <p>Clearly, I have a strong passion for music because it has this special ability to evoke emotions; it can strike something within us, and on the toughest of days, it can help to heal some of our personal damages.  </p>
            <h1>Happiness Project</h1>

            <h2><a href="http://www.24hoursofhappy.com">24 Hours of Happy</a></h2>
            <p>On November 21, 2013, hip-hop producer/artist Pharrell released the first ever 24 hour music video. The video begins at noon where his new single "happy" is continuously looped in concession with the 24 hour day. As the day progresses from afternoon to evening, to early morning and then late morning, the video follows over 400 Californians expressing themselves in happiness by dancing through the streets of LA. Amongst the 400 Civilians, celebrites such as Jaime Foxx, Kelly Osborne, Steve Carrell, Magic Johnson, and Jimmy Kimmel joined in on the fun, and expressed their own happiness. In the clip provided, I chose to show my favorite team of people, Odd Future (Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, and Jasper) giving their own personal take on what it means to use jazz hands.</p>
            <p>In a world filled with so much hate and negativity, one cannot deny the positive energy that this video exudes; as cheesy as it may sound, you can't help but smile at people just enjoying being happy. What Pharrell was trying to prove is that happiness (a sometimes forgotten emotion) can really be felt at all times of day; we're simply not limited to day-time happiness or night-time happiness.</p>
                <p>and the song "happy" plays on continuously on loop, and you get to see happiness at all times of the day. This ingenious ideaWith youtube clearly not being able to handle 24 hours of video content, the video had to be registered under it's own <a href="http://www.24hoursofhappy.com">domain.</a> </p>
