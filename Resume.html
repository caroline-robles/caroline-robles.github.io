            <ul>
                <li>Currently in the process of obtaining a Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunications with a track in Media and Society and a minor in Business Management</li>
                <li>Current GPA: 3.2</li>
                <li>Active member in "Heal the World", a service club dedicated to bettering not only our community, but also nationally, and internationally.</li>
                <li>Currently a writer for the music website <a href="http://www.Collegefuse.com">CollegeFuse</a></li>
            </ul>

        <p><a href="http://www.collegefuse.com"><img src="img/collegefuse.jpg" align="right" width=30% alt="CollegeFuse" title="CollegeFuse"  class="right" /></a></p>
            <p>CollegeFuse began with the hopes of providing college-aged individuals a source for finding new music, reviews of music they already love, and concert reviews of shows from around the world. Currently, contributors are from London, Toronto, LA, Georgia, and of course Florida. With such a dyanmic group of writers, readers are exposed to much more music than what's popular to them regionally.</p>
            <p>Personally, I feel so lucky to be part of an amazing website, as it has allowed me to freely express my opinions about one of the most passionate things in my life: music. I truely feel that this could be a stepping stone to really fulfilling my dreams and breaking into the music industry.</p>
