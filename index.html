            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <h2>Life Enthusiast and Music Lover</h2>
            <h3> <strong>The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams." <em>-Oprah Winfrey</em></strong></h3>
    
               <p>I am a junior at the beautiful <a href="http://www.UFL.edu">University of Florida</a> and working towards a degree in Telecommunications in Media and Society with a minor in Business Management.</p>
               <p>Ever since I was little, I have always been drawn to music. Music is the strongest element of art form; as it appeals to more than just our auditory sense. I am excited and hopeful that these passions for music will transition into a future career path, and I end up working somewhere within the industry. </p>
                <p>Passions of mine include: spending time with my loved ones and friends, playing with animals, going to concerts, discovering new artists, and who doesn't love getting lost in a television series? </p>
                <p>I've always heard the phrase, "if you do what you love, you never work a day in your life", and I'm finally beginning to understand thhat true meaning. Following my passions and working towards making my dreams a reality has been one of the greatest adventures of my life thus far.</p>
